    <h3>Summary of Us</h3>
   </strong></p>
  <p>The year 2013 had just opened up as we both look forward to a new year, to a new beginning. I, John, had began
   to take on my studies seriously in College and had no plans of being in a relationship with anyone.
   Michelle, while also in college, was studying hard and finishing up her undergrad. Who would had known that
   we both were meet that year and influence each others lives in a timely manner that will probably never repeat itself again.
